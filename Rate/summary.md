# Rate Maximization
## Environment Model

### Transmitter
The transmitter consists of $L$ LEDs so the symbol sent by the transmitter is 

$\vec{z}_{L \times 1} = \bold{W}_{L \times K} \vec{s}_{K \times 1} + \vec{p}_{L \times 1}$

where $\vec{s}$ is the vector containing the symbols of each user ($s_k$ is the symbol sent for the kth user)
